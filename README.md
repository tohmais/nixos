# NixOS Configuration

Notes for non-reproducible parts of system:
* Install Gear Lever to manage AppImages  
* Install ES-DE AppImage. NixOS core settings should already be placed in the correct spot.  
* Install Fightcade AppImage, use Flatseal to configure permissions to find specific training mode luas  
* Set up rescrobbled + stylix cookies/api keys

### Credits

* HUGE credit towards vimjoyer, whose videos encouraged me to start on my nix journey, and whose personal config I used for the base of this one.
    * I have copied particular files of their config. I have included the original licence of the repository in the file LICENCE-vimjoyer.  
    * I have also included a small copyright notice at the top of files I have copied significantly (I don't need to do this, I just wanted to attribute properly)
